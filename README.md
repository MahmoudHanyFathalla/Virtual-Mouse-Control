# Virtual-Mouse-Control
This project uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to detect hand gestures and control the mouse cursor on your computer screen in real-time. By tracking hand movements and recognizing specific gestures, the program enables intuitive control of the mouse, such as moving the cursor and simulating mouse clicks using hand gestures.
